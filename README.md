# How to use
Inside of each folder there is an independent terraform configuration with README file how to use it. Follow the instructions to deploy. You might need to change some command paths but no terraform code changes should be needed. You should run commands from the repo root folder (terraform-templates) or change the commands.
For each terraform configuration there are prerequisites specified in README. Some accounts like aws or cloudflare require a credit card but if the traffic is relatively low, there should be no chanrges (check free tiers).
